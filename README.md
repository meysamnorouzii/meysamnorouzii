Work Experience
This is the core of your portfolio. In Notion, the best way to manage this is with a Database. This allows you to add properties and keep everything organized.

Create a "Table" database with the following properties:

Role	Company	Dates	Location
Senior Front-End Developer	[Company Name]	[Month, Year] – Present	[City, Country]
Front-End Developer	[Company Name]	[Month, Year] – [Month, Year]	[City, Country]

Export to Sheets
Inside each entry (each role is its own page in Notion), add details like this:

Page Title: Senior Front-End Developer @ [Company Name]
